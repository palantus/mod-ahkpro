<p>Shared lists is a form of todo lists for which you do not need a user.</p>
<p>The product is divived up into two concepts - buckets and lists. Buckets contains lists and lists contains the actual todos.</p>
<p>Every bucket and list is identified by an ID which can be assigned manually or chosen randomly</p>
<p>If you have given for instance a list the ID "newlist", then it can be accessed by anyone at ahkpro.dk/sharedlists?l=newlist.</p>
<p>If it is a bucket, then it can be accessed by swapping the l= with b=.</p>
<p>If you do not choose an ID, then a random one is selected for you (like ba8fe7a5-2667-f38e-213b-3c98e3f23ed6).</p>
<p>This means that you can share lists and buckets with anyone and only those who knows the ID can view and modify them!</p>
<p>This can be accessed on a phone as well and even be used offline (reading only).</p>
